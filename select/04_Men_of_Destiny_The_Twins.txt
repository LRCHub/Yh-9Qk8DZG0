We are the advocates
Of a better world
We cannot be bargained with
Only bought or sold

The technological era
Will gain ascendancy
We derive our power
From pure energy

The technological era
Will modernize our time
Progress for everyone
Who agrees to tow the line

We are men of destiny
Men of muscle and brain
And without men of destiny
This planet has no aim

We await the day of judgement
It's not so far away
As long as we survive the fall-out
Everything will be okay
